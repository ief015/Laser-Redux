General gameplay:
- Add mild fall damage?
- Ammo should not display if the weapon doesn't use ammo.
- Laser nonce should always have infinite ammo. Maybe make the other weapons limited in ammo?



weapon_laser "Laser Nonce"
- If fall damage is added, right click shotgun takes too long to recharge.

weapon_fastlaser
- Primary fire cone spread is too large and makes the weapon very situational ... too close-quarters.

weapon_lasergun "Mini-laser gun"
- Fires too fast and recharge is too long to be practical.
- Could be a nice sidearm if firerate was lowered and an "overheating" mechanic was added.

weapon_lasergrenade
- No throwing animation is played.
- The grenade entity appears to be invisible.
- Maybe detonate on impact instead of fuse-time?
- Possibly useless? It is too situational.

weapon_lightning
- Errors on load:
[ERROR] gamemodes/laser_arcade_2.0/entities/weapons/weapon_lightning/shared.lua:144: unexpected symbol near 'if'
  1. unknown - gamemodes/laser_arcade_2.0/entities/weapons/weapon_lightning/shared.lua:0

weapon_shotgunlaser
- Feels solid.
- Primary fire charge time may be too long.
- Charging may be too long if fall damage is implemented.

weapon_sniperlaser
- No complaints, feels solid.
- Should crosshair only show up while scoped instead of all the time?

weapon_translocator
- Possibly useless?
- Errors when firing beacon:
[ERROR] gamemodes/laser_arcade_2.0/entities/weapons/weapon_translocator/shared.lua:90: attempt to call method 'GetAngle' (a nil value)
  1. unknown - gamemodes/laser_arcade_2.0/entities/weapons/weapon_translocator/shared.lua:90
